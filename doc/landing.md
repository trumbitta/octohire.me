# Hey GitHub, you think you should hire me. Why is that?
## Or maybe not, but you're still reading. Dont' stop just yet.

My name is William Ghelfi, nice to meet you. [You should hire me](mailto:william@williamghelfi.com).

I'm an [eclectic](#why-eclectic) Web Developer with 15+ years work experience in software development.  
I love creating things. My [current tools of the trade](#why-learner) are: pen & paper, Balsamiq Mockups, HTML & CSS, AngularJS.

My ideal work routine starts with constant research, analyzing the UX of everything I stumble upon: from a parking meter to GitHub’s home page.  
Then comes the paper, and a low-fidelity mockup.

The mockup is then shared, feedback is quickly collected, [processed](#why-strong-voice), and merged into the design.

Finally, the funniest part: implementation!
Give me Sublime Text and a Gruntfile, and let me do my thing.

I know: [you want to see a portfolio of sorts](#portfolio). And that's ok; as it happens, I've got one!

## Here's some more about me, though.

* **Eclectic.** I'm that guy who can talk to DevOps, share some tricks, get some insights; who then listens to a back end dev and *actually understands what they're saying*; who then again gets back to have a conversation with others in the UX team, and finally comes up with a design that just nails it.  
You need that guy. You need me.

* **Born, growing up.** It's my motto. I am the continous learner: I learn, therefore I live. Today, I'm having a very good time with Angular. Tomorrow, maybe I'll dig into React. Or I'll go back learning how to build my own REST back ends with Rails from where I left the first time.  
I have to learn, just like a shark has to roam. You need someone like me.

* **I have my own voice.** I listen, I observe. But I speak with my own voice. With my designs - ok, with just anything really – I like to research, try, get feedback, fail if it comes to that, own my failure, take responsibility, and do better the next time around.  
I won't comply, I won't conform just out of the fear of failure. You need that.
