          My name is William Ghelfi, nice to meet you. <a href="#get-in-touch">You should hire me</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm an <a href="#why-eclectic">eclectic</a> Web Developer with 15+ years work experience in software development.<br />
          I love creating things. My <a href="#why-learner">current tools of the trade</a> are: pen & paper, Balsamiq Mockups, HTML & CSS, AngularJS.
        </p>

        <p>
          My ideal work routine starts with continuous research, analyzing the UX of everything I stumble upon: from a parking meter to GitHub’s home page.<br />
          After the research comes the paper, and a low-fidelity mockup.
        </p>

        <p>
          The mockup is then shared, feedback is quickly collected, <a href="#why-unique-voice">processed</a>, and merged into the design.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, the best part: building &amp; shipping!<br />
          Give me Sublime Text and a Gruntfile, and let me do my thing.
        </p>

        <p>
          I know: <a href="#portfolio">you want to see a portfolio of sorts</a>. And that's ok; as it happens, I've got one!

          <h3>Eclectic.</h3>
          <p>
            I'm that guy who can talk to DevOps, share some tricks, get some insights; who then listens to a back-end dev and <em>actually understands what they're saying</em>.<br />
            Who then again gets back to have a conversation with others in the UX team, and finally comes up with a design that just nails it.
          </p>
          <p>
            You need that guy. You need me.

          <h3>Born, growing up.</h3>
          <p>
            It's my motto. I am the continous learner: I learn, therefore I live. Today, I'm having a very good time with Angular. Tomorrow, maybe I'll dig into React.<br />
            Or I'll go back learning how to build my own REST back ends with Rails from where I left the first time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have to learn, just like a shark has to roam. You need someone like me.

        <article id="why-unique-voice" class="col-md-4">
          <h3>My own voice.</h3>
          <p>
            I listen, I observe. But I speak with my own voice.<br />
            With my designs - ok, with just anything really – I like to research, try, get feedback, fail if it comes to that, own my failure, take responsibility, and do better the next time around.
          </p>
          <p>
            I won't comply, I won't conform just out of the fear of failure. You need that.
