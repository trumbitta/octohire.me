  <h1>Hey GitHub, you think you should hire me. Why is that?</h1>
  <h2>Or maybe not, but you're still reading. Dont' stop just yet.</h2>

  <p>
    My name is William Ghelfi, nice to meet you. <a href="mailto:william@williamghelfi.com">You should hire me</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm an [eclectic](#why-eclectic) Web Developer with 15+ years work experience in software development.<br />
    I love creating things. My [current tools of the trade](#why-learner) are: pen & paper, Balsamiq Mockups, HTML & CSS, AngularJS.
  </p>

  <p>
    My ideal work routine starts with constant research, analyzing the UX of everything I stumble upon: from a parking meter to GitHub’s home page.<br />
    After the research comes the paper, and a low-fidelity mockup.
  </p>

  <p>
    The mockup is then shared, feedback is quickly collected, [processed](#why-strong-voice), and merged into the design.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, the funniest part: implementation!<br />
    Give me Sublime Text and a Gruntfile, and let me do my thing.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know: [you want to see a portfolio of sorts](#portfolio). And that's ok; as it happens, I've got one!
  </p>

  <h2>Here's some more about me, though.</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Eclectic.</strong> I'm that guy who can talk to DevOps, share some tricks, get some insights; who then listens to a back end dev and *actually understands what they're saying*; who then again gets back to have a conversation with others in the UX team, and finally comes up with a design that just nails it.<br />
      You need that guy. You need me.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Born, growing up.</strong> It's my motto. I am the continous learner: I learn, therefore I live. Today, I'm having a very good time with Angular. Tomorrow, maybe I'll dig into React. Or I'll go back learning how to build my own REST back ends with Rails from where I left the first time.<br />
      I have to learn, just like a shark has to roam. You need someone like me.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>I have my own voice.</strong> I listen, I observe. But I speak with my own voice. With my designs - ok, with just anything really – I like to research, try, get feedback, fail if it comes to that, own my failure, take responsibility, and do better the next time around.<br />
      I won't comply, I won't conform just out of the fear of failure. You need that.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Don't take my word for it</h2>
